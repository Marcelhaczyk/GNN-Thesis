# GNN-Thesis
The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has emerged as an effective solution for analyzing and interpreting complex, unstructured datasets. Our motivation was to bridge the gap between human and robot interaction and create a more robust, and insightful data analysis framework. 
This work investigates a novel method for combining additional GNNs and NLP methods, such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization, to provide informative graphical data representations and reliable predictions of personality traits. 
Additionally, it provides a literature review of regression techniques, detailing the usage of common libraries and toolkits. It elaborates on the data preparation process, including dataset selection, preprocessing, integration, and collection of personality labels. Whatâ€™s more, our experiments explicate the NLP and GNN model implementations and hyperparameter selection. They present the generated graph structures and the network visualization via TensorBoard, evaluate model performance using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and discuss the predictive outcomes in personality trait forecasting.
