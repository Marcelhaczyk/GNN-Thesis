Nice to meet you, very well pronouncing my name, wow very impressed.
Hettie could you please bring your face closer and stand still so I can learn your face?
Yes is this close enough? Where are you looking you are not looking at me. 
I am afraid I couldn't learn your face Hettie let's try again. Thank you Hettie, I have now learned your face and can recognize you when I see you again.
I am sure you did not learn my face you were looking at the wall but okay 
I was.
Yeah okay okay I trust you.
So tell me Hettie, how has your day been?
Yes, the day has been fine but started a bit interestingly I was in the hospital.
Sorry to hear that, let's hope I can cheer you up somehow.
Yes, let's hope. I'm looking forward to you cheer me up.

Thank you. Hettie, tell me are you also having a good time? 
I am enjoying it yes, amazing performance, I am having a great time.
I am glad you are enjoying yourself. So tell me Hettie, what do you do for a living? 
For a living, I do research and I teach summer lecture. Actually, I also do things like, you know, getting you into the group and letting you do all these grooming moves and stuff. So working on this is part of my job.
That is a cool job.
Yes it is.
Do you like your job Hettie?
Yes I like my job, I love it.
Nice! You sound very enthusiastic about it.
Yes I am enthusiastic.
Hettie I have a personal question for you as well
Yes
Are you happy with your choices you have made in your life? If you could go back in time and change one thing, what would it be?
Yes, I am happy with the choices I made, but I will probably change something because not everything I am able to change, sometimes life decides for me 
I see, just keep in mind that every choice in our life is what made us into what we are in the end.
Oh wow, that is amazing, I love it, you are so right.
So Hettie, could you also tell me of any unpleasant experiences you have in your life? Of course, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.
Yes, so some of the unpleasant experiences I have in my life, and they're still happening, is working with people is very challenging, is amazing, but also is very challenging, so we encounter every type of person doing our job, that could be student, that could be also managers or even people who keep an eye on the labs for equipment, so that makes it somehow frustrating, but that's an outdated experience, I can share it with you.
Well, that doesn't sound so bad, I'm sure you're feeling better now.
Yes, yes, having seen you, I feel better, that is true.
