I am Nao. You on my right, perhaps. Could you please stand up?
OK, my name is Julie.
I am Nao. What is your name?
My name is Julie.
Um, um. Can you bring your face closer? I want to learn your face.
Close enough?
I could not learn your face. I will try again. Bring it closer. OK. I have now learned your face. Julie, how was your day? 
Good. 
Well, good. Um. Do you want me to play some music for you?
Yes.
Hope you like it. Um. Well, are you having a positive experience now to me?
Yes, I am.
Um, Julie. What is your job? Do you like it?
I'm a researcher and yeah, I do.
Well, good. Um, well, I was trying to ask you a personal question. Is there something you would like to change in your life, Julie?
Not really, no. 
Well, good. Julie, which was the happiest moment of your life?
I would say I got married recently and that was a very, very happy day.
Well, sounds good. Do you like robots, Julie? 
Yeah.
That is good. Have you watched wall-e?
No.
Well, it is a good movie.
