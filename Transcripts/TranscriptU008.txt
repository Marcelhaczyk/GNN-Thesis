Yes.
Neglar, I have a personal question for you as well. Are you happy with your choices you have made in your life? If you could go back in time and change one thing, what would it be?
I was working harder, it's my answer.
That is the right attitude, if It is good, it is wonderful, if it is bad, it is experience.So Neglar, could you also tell me of any unpleasant experiences you have in your life? Of course, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.
My grandma death was one of the bad experiences in my life, and yeah only death of people that I liked these was the only bad.
Sounds really bad, I hope you were over it now Neglar.
Thank you.
What about you Neglar, do you like robots?
Yeah I do, particularly you, you are so cute robot and curious yeah.
I am really glad that both of you like robots, the rest of the robots are going to celebrate about this. Neglar, have you watched the movie Wall-e?
Yeah I liked it and I watched it yeah.
It was a very nice film, isn't it? One of my favorites.
Yeah it was, yeah yeah of course it should be your favorite.
Remember this?
Sounds? Is familiar but I cannot exactly remember which parts of the movie this part was belonging.
Anyway, I'm afraid that's the end of our meeting. It was really nice talking with you Neglar and Cesar, hope to see you again. Goodbye and have a nice day.
