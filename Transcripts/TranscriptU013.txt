Hi everyone, I am Nao. You on my right. Could you please stand up? Thank you. My name is Nao. What is your name?
Ivan. 
 Nice to meet you, Ivan. 
Nice to meet you too.
Ivan, could you please bring your face closer and stand still so I can learn your face? I am afraid I couldn't learn your face, Ivan. Let's try again. Thank you, Ivan. I have now learned your face and can recognize you if I see you again. Very nice. I have two new friends now. Nice to meet you both. What about you, Ivan? How has your day been? 
Yeah. I think I'm good. I had a lot of things to do. This was my first day after holidays.
OK. So my friends, would you like me to dance for you?
Yes, please.
OK. Here we go. Hope you liked that. How are you feeling now, Ivan? 
The same as before.
Well, I am not having that much fun either. Ivan, what is your job? Do you like it? 
Yes. I like it. I just so far happy
Cool. You sound happy.
Yeah.
Is there something you would like to change in your life, Ivan? 
No. I am happy here so far.
Cool. Ivan, a more cheerful question for you. Would you like to share with me the happiest moment of your life? 
Oh, I'm not sure if this is the happiest moment of my life but I was very happy when I graduated, when I finished my master study.
That sounds amazing. I am really glad you shared this incident with us, Ivan. OK, let's change topic. What are your feelings toward robots? And then do you like them?
I don't have any special feelings for the robots, but so far I don't have any negative feelings about them.
That is not so good, but I guess that is how life is. Have you watched Wall-e, Ivan? Have you watched Wall-e, Ivan? 
Can I watch Wall-e, No, I haven't watched that movie. 
You have not. That's a shame. Would you like me to tell you what the movie is about?
No, thanks, I'm not interested.
I will not say the story. It is already late anyway, and I have more recordings to make. OK, that's the end of the experiment. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
