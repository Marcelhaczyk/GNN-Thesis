It's been good, it started very early with the meeting, well actually it started, I didn't sleep very well so it didn't start very good, but then I went to the meeting and it was very good and then and now I am here and let's see how it goes.
That sounds amazing.So my friends, would you like me to dance for you?
Yes.
Okay here we go.

My feelings? I am in state of amazement, because I am interacting with a robot, and I think it's very cool.
Sounds like you were having fun.
Yes I am.
Let's turn to you now Cesar, what do you do for a living, is your job fulfilling?
I am a PhD student, it is fulfilling, it's very satisfying, I couldn't think of a better thing to be doing right now with my life.
Very nice! As Confucius said, choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.Now more personal question Cesar, is there something you would like to change in your life?
Something I would like to change in my life, no no, actually no I think I am pretty good right now the way I am, so I wouldn't change anything in my life.
I see, good luck for that
Thank you.
Cesar, a more cheerful question for you. Would you like to share with me the happiest moment of your life?
I have had many happy moments in my life, in no particular order for example when my daughter was born, when I got accepted in the PhD, yeah I think those two are so very important moments in my life, happy moments in my life.
That sounds amazing, I am really glad you shared the this incident with us Cesar.Ok, let's change topic, what are your feelings toward robots, Caesar? Do you like them?
Yeah I do, I like them, I think they are very useful and they will make our life much easier, they will automate many tasks in our lives and they will help the human race advance as a whole to achieve greater things.
