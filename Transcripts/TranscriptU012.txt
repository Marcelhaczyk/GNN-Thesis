Thank you. My name is NAO. What is your name? 
Thomas. 
Nice to meet you, Thomas.
U12:Great.
Thomas, could you please bring your face closer and stand still so I can learn your face? 
Mhm.
Thank you, Thomas. I have now learned your face and can recognize you if I see you again. 
Great.
So tell me, Thomas, how has your day been?
Pretty good so far.
That sounds amazing.
Great. It is amazing.
So my friends, would you like me to dance for you?
What was that?
So my friends, would you like me to dance for you?
I didn't understand. Aaa, dance.
OK. Here we go.
No, I don't care for dancing. How about jumping?
Hope you liked that.
That was terrible.
Thomas, are you having a better time? 
Not really.
What a pity. What is your job, Thomas?
Hey, what was that?
What is your job, Thomas?
Eee, my job, PhD student.
Good. Do you like it?
It's OK.
That sounds bad.Thomas says there's something you would like to change in your life.
Yes, I would like a robot servant.
That's just the right attitude. If it is good, it is wonderful. If it is bad, it is experience.
That sounds very stupid.
So, Thomas, could you also tell me of any unpleasant experiences you have in your life? Of course, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.
Unpleasant experience? Yes. I was involved in a dispute with an employer. That was not very pleasant.
Well, that doesn't sound so bad. I'm sure you're feeling better now. And you Thomas? Do you like robots?
Yes, I like real robots.
Good. 50% of the humans in front of me like robots. Have you watched Wall-e?
Wall-e yes, I watched it.
It was a very nice film, wasn't it? One of my favorites.
It was OK.
Remember this? OK, that's the end of the experiment.Goodbye.
Goodbye.
